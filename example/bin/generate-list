Here's what you have to do with this file:
(1) Print this file to paper.
(2) Compute this file's MD5 checksum and optionally also its SHA1 checksum.
   gpg --print-md md5 ksp-glt07.txt   (or use md5sum)
   gpg --print-md sha1 ksp-glt07.txt  (or use sha1sum)
(3) fill in the hash values on the printout.
(4) Bring the printout, a pen, and proof of identity to the keysigningparty (and be on time!).

MD5 Checksum:  __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __    __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __           [ ]



SHA1 Checksum: ____ ____ ____ ____ ____    ____ ____ ____ ____ ____         [ ]
