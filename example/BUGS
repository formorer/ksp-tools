- Its not possible to detect if one person has more than one key. 
  So its possible that somebody has a key on the different positions 
  on the sheet. I try to avoid this by sorting them the date of their 
  submission. But if somebody later reupload only one key this is lost. 
  I don't know a solution for this problem... If you know one - Tell me.
