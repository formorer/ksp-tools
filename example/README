WARNING: the tools use relative path names. So go into your directory an call them like: bin/generate-list 

- Copy example/ to a usefull directory name - eg. ksp-froscon07/
- Edit conf/vars 
- Adjust the text in bin/generate-list and conf/mail-header 
  (WARNING: don't forget to add $KSPFILE as in conf/vars to the mail-header, otherwise people can be irritated :)) 
  TODO: use some kind of template language....
- If you don't run the kspkeyserver just drop the keys into a directory named keys/

If you have keys you can run the following tools: 

bin/generate-list - generates the classic KSP sheets and keyrings
bin/generate-mailadds - reads the KSPFILE and extracts all mailaddresses
bin/mail-send - uses nail to send a mail to all participants. $KSPFILE gets attached. The text for the mail is in conf/mail-header.
